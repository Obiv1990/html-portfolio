<hr />
<h3>GTO-Great teacher Onizuka</h3>
<p> Free Spirtied man finds himself as a subsitude teacher in a university.<br />3
    and this series is based on his journey as a teacher with a little slice of life
</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<P>Where to even begin, personally one of the best series i have ever watched.<br />
this series has almost everything that life would usually throw upon your way.<br />
the series has about 1k+ episodes and still on going. great watch if you have the time.</P>

<h3>NCIS-Naval Criminal Investigative Service</h3>
<p>A true binge worthy show for me. 21 seasons with about 20+ episodes per season, <br />
sounds a lot but as you watch and get into it, you would wish there was a little bit more.<br />
it is a crime genre series with a little bit of drama here and there. they solve different<br />
crimes per episodes that is why it is a true binge worthy show for me</p>
